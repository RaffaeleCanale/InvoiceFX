- Use a Preferences manager to keep track of the all the nodes where we have prefences (or at least, find a way to find those nodes)

- ArchiveManager: Retreive a specific record
- Drive Sync Icon: Show a tooltip
- Sync error: More information

- Better "Advanced Config" Window: Sort tables, more controls, etc...

- List (exhaustively) all the components that need to be loaded in a graph!
- Draw a graph of all bindings for every window

- Update: Have a Singleton Update Thread that will check for update available from time to time
